I would venture to say that the Dualshock 4 is the perfect controller with no flaws... except for it's two flaws:

1. micro USB (yuck!)
2. the D-PAD

Thankfully both problems are easy to fix! The first with an [already-made](https://lectronz.com/products/ps4-controller-usb-c) Type-C port replacement, and the second by swapping the single slab of D-PAD plastic with individual buttons.

# What's wrong with the D-PAD?

One of my current favorite rhythm games is [Project Heartbeat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1216230/Project_Heartbeat/). It is a game based on the **Project Diva** series but with Steam workshop support, leaderboards, and a chart editor!

I am at a stage where I play very quick charts, some of which consist of spamming the same (or alternating) buttons super fast. Stuff like the following isn't super uncommon:

The reason the D-PAD is an issue in this case is because of... well, maybe just the way I play.

If I press down on the D-PAD with enough horizontal force, it can cause an input with the right D-PAD direction. Fighting game players have already [discussed this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/gi292a/opinions_on_connected_vs_separate_dpad_buttons/), and to some it is their preference that each D-PAD button is, in fact, a separate button. Given the misinputs I've been causing for myself, I'm about ready to say it's my preference too.

But first...

# Adding USB-C

When ordering the USB-C replacement, it's important to order the right one. Different models of the Dualshock 4 have micro USB modules that connect differently, and since the USB-C replacement uses the existing ribbon cable, it's important to get the right one. Each micro USB port has a different model number printed on it at least, so it's easy to tell.

Installing it is as simple as cracking the controller open and removing the old port...

...and installing the new port! Simple as that.

# Switching the D-PADs

For this I ordered the [eXtremeRate Ergonomic Split Dpad Buttons](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B097D3GWT4), but you could probably just cut up and sand the existing plastic slab into separate buttons honestly.

Swapping the buttons is stupid easy. Just keep the membrane and swap the plastic, that's it!

There, much better!
